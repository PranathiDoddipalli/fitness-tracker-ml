# Fitness Tracker Machine Learning Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze fitness data and provide insights into physical activity and exercise performance.

## Overview

The Fitness Tracker Machine Learning Project processes data from wearable fitness devices, applying machine learning models to classify activities and evaluate performance metrics.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses raw fitness data.
- **Activity Classification**: Identifies different physical activities using machine learning algorithms.
- **Performance Insights**: Analyzes exercise performance metrics to give meaningful feedback.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure the required Python libraries are installed (listed below).
3. **Run the Notebook**: Use the provided Jupyter notebook to explore and execute the project.
